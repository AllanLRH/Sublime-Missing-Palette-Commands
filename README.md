# Missing Palette Commands, smaller version

While [Missing Palette Commands], which seem to enable access to all menu menu elements from the palette command, this only provides access to the ones I use most of the time.

This package provides a `.sublime-commands` file that contains
the missing commands. You can install it using [Package Control], and choosing to install from a repository.
